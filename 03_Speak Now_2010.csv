Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,1,"You were in college,working part-time,waiting tables"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,2,Left a small town and never looked back
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,3,"I was a flight risk,with a fear of falling"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,4,"Wondering why we bother with love,if it never lasts"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,5,"I say,""Can you believe it?"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,6,As we're lying on the couch
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,7,"The moment,I could see it"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,8,"Yes,yes,I can see it now"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,9,"Do you remember,we were sitting there,by the water?"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,10,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,11,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,12,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,13,"Flash forward,and we're taking on the world together"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,14,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,15,You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,16,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,17,But we got bills to pay
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,18,We got nothing figured out
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,19,When it was hard to take
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,20,"Yes,yes"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,21,This is what I thought about:
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,22,"Do you remember,we were sitting there,by the water?"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,23,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,24,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,25,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,26,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,27,You saw me start to believe for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,28,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,29,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,30,"And I remember that fight,2:30 AM"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,31,As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,32,"I ran out,crying,and you followed me out into the street"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,33,Braced myself for the goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,34,Cause that's all I've ever known
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,35,"Then,you took me by surprise"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,36,"You said,""I'll never leave you alone."""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,37,"You said,""I remember how we felt,sitting by the water"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,38,"And every time I look at you,it's like the first time"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,39,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,40,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,41,"Hold on,make it last"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,42,"Hold on,never turn back"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,43,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,44,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,45,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,46,Do you believe it?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,47,(Hold on)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,48,We're gonna make it now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,49,(Hold on)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,50,And I can see it
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,51,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,1,Mine,52,I can see it now (see it now)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,1,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,2,And I'm a house of cards
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,3,You're the kind of reckless
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,4,That should send me running
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,5,But I kinda know that I won't get far
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,6,And you stood there in front of me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,7,Just close enough to touch
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,8,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,9,What I was thinking of
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,10,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,11,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,12,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,13,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,14,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,15,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,16,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,17,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,18,My mind forgets to remind me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,19,You're a bad idea
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,20,You touch me once and it's really something
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,21,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,22,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,23,But with you I know it's no good
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,24,And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,25,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,26,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,27,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,28,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,29,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,30,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,31,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,32,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,33,I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,34,"Just keep on keeping your eyes on me,it's just wrong enough to make it feel right"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,35,And lead me up the staircase
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,36,Won't you whisper soft and slow?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,37,"I'm captivated by you,baby,like a firework show"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,38,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,39,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,40,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,41,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,42,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,43,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,44,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,45,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,46,And the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,47,"Oh,baby,smile"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,48,And the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,1,I'm so glad you made time to see me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,2,"How's life,tell me,how's your family"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,3,I haven't seen them in a while
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,4,"You've been good,busier than ever"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,5,"We small talk,work and the weather"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,6,Your guard is up and I know why
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,7,Cause the last time you saw me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,8,Is still burned in the back of your mind
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,9,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,10,So this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,11,"Standing in front of you,saying I'm sorry for that night"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,12,And I'd go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,13,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,14,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,15,"I'd go back to December,turn around and make it alright"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,16,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,17,These days I haven't been sleeping
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,18,Staying up playing back myself leaving
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,19,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,20,"And I think about summer,all the beautiful times"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,21,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,22,Realized I loved you in the fall
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,23,And then the cold came
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,24,The dark days when fear crept into my mind
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,25,You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,26,So this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,27,"Standing in front of you,saying I'm sorry for that night"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,28,And I'd go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,29,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,30,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,31,"I'd go back to December,turn around and change my own mind"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,32,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,33,"I miss your tan skin,your sweet smile,so good to me,so right"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,34,And how you held me in your arms that September night
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,35,The first time you ever saw me cry
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,36,Maybe this is wishful thinking
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,37,Probably mindless dreaming
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,38,But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,39,"I'd go back in time and change it,but I can't"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,40,"So if the chain is on your door,I understand"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,41,But this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,42,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,43,And I'd go back to December...
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,44,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,45,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,46,"I'd go back to December,turn around and make it alright"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,47,"I'd go back to December,turn around and change my own mind"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,48,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,3,Back To December,49,All the time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,1,I am not the kind of girl
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,2,Who should be rudely barging in
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,3,On a white veil occasion
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,4,But you are not the kind of boy
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,5,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,6,I sneak in and see your friends
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,7,And her snotty little family
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,8,All dressed in pastel
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,9,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,10,Somewhere back inside a room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,11,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,12,This is surely not
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,13,What you thought it would be
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,14,I lose myself in a daydream
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,15,Where I stand and say
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,16,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,17,I'll meet you when you're out
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,18,Of the church at the back door
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,19,Don't wait or say a single vow
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,20,You need to hear me out
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,21,"And they said ""speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,22,Fond gestures are exchanged
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,23,And the organ starts to play
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,24,A song that sounds like a death march
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,25,And I am hiding in the curtains
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,26,It seems that I was uninvited
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,27,By your lovely bride-to-be
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,28,She floats down the aisle
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,29,Like a pageant queen
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,30,But I know you wish it was me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,31,You wish it was me (Don't you)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,32,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,33,I'll meet you when you're out

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,47,I hear the preacher say
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,48,"""Speak now or forever hold your peace"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,49,"There's the silence,there's my last chance"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,50,"I stand up with shaking hands,all eyes on me"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,51,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,52,But I'm only looking at you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,53,I am not the kind of girl

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,71,"""Speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,1,Long were the nights when
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,2,My days once revolved around you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,3,Counting my footsteps
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,4,Praying the floor won't fall through... again
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,5,My mother accused me of losing my mind
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,6,But I swore I was fine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,7,You paint me a blue sky
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,8,Then go back and turn it to rain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,9,And I lived in your chess game
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,10,But you changed the rules everyday
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,11,"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone,tonight"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,12,Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,13,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,14,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,15,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,16,I shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,17,Well maybe it's me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,18,And my blind optimism to blame
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,19,Or maybe it's you and your sick need
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,20,To give love and take it away
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,21,And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,22,Who don't understand
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,23,And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,24,"""Run as fast as you can"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,25,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,26,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,27,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,28,"Dear John,I see it all now it was wrong"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,29,Don't you think nineteen's too young
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,30,"To be played by your dark,twisted games"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,31,When I loved you so?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,32,I shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,33,You are an expert at sorry
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,34,And keeping the lines blurry
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,35,Never impressed by me acing your tests
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,36,All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,37,Cause you burned them out
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,38,But I took your matches
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,39,Before fire could catch me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,40,So don't look now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,41,I'm shining like fireworks
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,42,"Over your sad empty town,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,43,"Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,44,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,45,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,46,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,47,I see it all now that you're gone
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,48,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,49,The girl in the dress
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,50,"Wrote you a song,you shoulda' known"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,51,You shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,52,Don't you think I was too young
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,5,Dear John,53,You shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,1,"You,with your words like knives"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,2,And swords and weapons that you use against me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,3,You have knocked me off my feet again
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,4,Got me feeling like I'm nothing
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,5,"You,with your voice like nails on a chalkboard"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,6,Calling me out when I'm wounded
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,7,"You,picking on the weaker man"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,8,But you can take me down with just one single blow
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,9,But you don't know what you don't know
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,10,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,11,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,12,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,13,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,14,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,15,"You,with your switching sides"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,16,And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,17,You have pointed out my flaws again
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,18,As if I don't already see them
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,19,"I walk with my head down,trying to block you out"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,20,Cause I'll never impress you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,21,I just want to feel okay again
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,22,I bet you got pushed around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,23,Somebody made you cold
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,24,But the cycle ends right now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,25,Cause you can't lead me down that road
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,26,And you don't know what you don't know
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,27,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,28,And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,30,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,31,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,32,And I can see you years from now in a bar
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,33,Talking over a football game
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,34,With that same big loud opinion
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,35,But nobody's listening
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,36,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,37,Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,38,But all you are is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,39,All you are is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,40,"And a liar,and pathetic,and alone in life"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,41,"And mean,and mean,and mean,and mean"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,42,But someday I'll be living in a big old city
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,43,"And all you're ever going to be is mean,yeah!"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,44,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,45,And all you're ever going to be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,46,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,47,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,48,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,49,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,50,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,51,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,52,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,53,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,6,Mean,54,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,1,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,2,How we met
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,3,And the sparks flew instantly
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,4,And people would say they're the lucky ones
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,5,I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,6,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,7,Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,8,"Oh,a simple complication"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,9,Miscommunications lead to fallout
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,10,So many things that I wish you knew
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,11,So many walls up that I can't break through
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,12,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,13,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,14,And I'm dying to know
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,15,Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,16,"Yeah,I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,when it all broke down"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,17,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,18,Next chapter
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,19,How'd we end up this way?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,20,See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,21,And you're doing your best to avoid me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,22,I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,23,Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,24,But you held your pride like you should have held me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,25,"Oh,I'm scared to see the ending"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,26,Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,27,"I'd tell you I miss you,but I don't know how"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,28,I've never heard silence quite this loud
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,29,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,30,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,31,And I'm dying to know

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,34,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,35,This is looking like a contest
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,36,Of who can act like they care less
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,37,But I liked it better when you were on my side
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,38,The battle's in your hands now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,39,But I would lay my armor down
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,40,If you say you'd rather love than fight
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,41,So many things that you wish I knew
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,42,But the story of us might be ending soon
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,43,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,44,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,45,And I'm dying to know

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,49,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,50,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,51,Yeah
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,52,"And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,because we're going down"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,53,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,54,The End
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,1,Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,2,And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,3,Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,4,"So I tuck you in,turn on your favorite night light"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,5,"To you everything's funny,you got nothing to regret"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,6,"I'd give all I have,honey"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,7,If you could stay like that
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,8,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,9,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,10,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,11,"Don't you ever grow up,it could stay this simple"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,12,"I won't let nobody hurt you,won't let no one break your heart"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,13,And no one will desert you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,14,"Just try to never grow up,never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,15,You're in the car on the way to the movies
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,16,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,17,At 14 there's just so much you can't do
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,18,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,19,But don't make her drop you off around the block
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,20,Remember that she's getting older too
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,21,And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,22,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,23,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,24,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,26,"No one's ever burned you,nothing's ever left you scarred"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,27,"And even though you want to,just try to never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,28,Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,29,Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,30,"Remember the footsteps,remember the words said"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,31,And all your little brother's favorite songs
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,32,I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,33,So here I am in my new apartment
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,34,"In a big city,they just dropped me off"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,35,It's so much colder that I thought it would be
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,36,So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,37,Wish I'd never grown up
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,38,I wish I'd never grown up
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,39,"Oh I don't wanna grow up,wish I'd never grown up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,40,I could still be little
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,41,"Oh I don't wanna grow up,wish I'd never grown up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,42,It could still be simple
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,43,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,44,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,45,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,49,"And even though you want to,please try to never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,50,"Oh,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,51,"Oh,never grow up,just never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,1,There I was again tonight
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,2,"Forcing laughter,faking smiles"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,3,"Same old tired,lonely place"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,4,"Walls of insincerity,shifting eyes and vacancy"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,5,Vanished when I saw your face

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,2,"Ha,time for a little revenge"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,3,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,4,"I had it all,I had him right there,where I wanted him"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,5,"She came along,got him alone,and let's hear the applause"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,6,She took him faster than you can say sabotage
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,7,"I never saw it coming,wouldn't have suspected it"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,8,I underestimated just who I was dealing with
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,9,She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,10,She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,11,She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,12,"She's an actress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,13,She's better known for the things that she does

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,20,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,21,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,22,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,23,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,24,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,25,"Oh,they didn't teach you that in prep school,so it's up to me"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,26,But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,27,She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,28,"She's an actress,whoa"

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,47,"There is nothing I do better than revenge,HA!"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,48,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,49,"Cause I don't think you do,oh"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,50,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,51,"I don't think you do,I don't think you do"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,52,Let's hear the applause
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,53,"Come on,show me how much better you are (so much better,yeah?)"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,54,See you deserve some applause
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,55,Cause you're so much better
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,56,She took him faster than you could say sabotage
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,11,Innocent,1,I guess you really did it this time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,11,Innocent,2,Left yourself in your warpath
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,11,Innocent,3,Lost your balance on a tightrope
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,11,Innocent,4,Lost your mind trying to get it back

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,12,Haunted,47,(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,12,Haunted,48,You and I walk a fragile line
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,12,Haunted,49,I have known it all this time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,12,Haunted,50,Never ever thought I'd see it break
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,12,Haunted,51,Never thought I'd see it
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,1,I still remember the look on your face
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,2,Lit through the darkness at 1:58
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,3,The words that you whispered
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,4,For just us to know
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,5,You told me you loved me
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,6,So why did you go away?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,7,Away
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,8,I do recall now the smell of the rain
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,9,Fresh on the pavement
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,10,I ran off the plane
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,11,That July 9th
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,12,The beat of your heart
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,13,It jumps through your shirt
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,14,I can still feel your arms
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,15,But now I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,16,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,17,All that I know is
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,18,I don't know how to be something you miss
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,19,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,20,Never imagined we'd end like this
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,21,"Your name,forever the name on my lips"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,22,I do remember the swing of your step
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,23,"The life of the party,you're showing off again"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,24,And I roll my eyes and then
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,25,You pull me in
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,26,I'm not much for dancing
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,27,But for you I did
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,28,"Because I love your handshake,meeting my father"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,29,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,30,How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,31,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,32,But now I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,33,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,34,All that I know is

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,38,"Your name,forever the name on my lips"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,39,So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,40,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,41,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,42,Hope it's nice where you are
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,43,And I hope the sun shines
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,44,And it's a beautiful day
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,45,And something reminds you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,46,You wish you had stayed
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,47,You can plan for a change in weather and time
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,48,But I never planned on you changing your mind
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,49,So I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,50,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,51,All that I know is

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,56,Just like our last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,57,Forever the name on my lips
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,58,Forever the name on my lips
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,59,Just like our last
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,1,"I said remember this moment,in the back of my mind"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,2,The time we stood with our shaking hands
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,3,The crowds in the stands went wild
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,4,We were the Kings and the Queens
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,5,And they read off our names
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,6,The night you danced like you knew our lives
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,7,Would never be the same
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,8,You held your head like a hero
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,9,On a history book page
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,10,It was the end of a decade
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,11,But the start of an age
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,12,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,13,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,14,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,15,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,16,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,17,I said remember this feeling
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,18,I passed the pictures around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,19,Of all the years that we stood there
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,20,On the side-lines wishing for right now
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,21,We are the Kings and the Queens
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,22,You traded your baseball cap for a crown
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,23,When they gave us our trophies
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,24,And we held them up for our town
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,25,And the cynics were outraged
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,26,"Screaming ""this is absurd"""
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,27,Cause for a moment a band of thieves
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,28,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,29,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,30,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,31,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,32,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,33,I'm not afraid
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,34,Long live all the mountains we moved
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,35,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,36,I was screaming long live that look on your face
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,37,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,38,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,39,Hold on to spinning around
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,40,Confetti falls to the ground
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,41,May these memories break our fall
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,42,Will you take a moment?
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,43,Promise me this
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,44,That you'll stand by me forever
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,45,But if God forbid fate should step in
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,46,And force us into a goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,47,If you have children some day
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,48,When they point to the pictures
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,49,Please tell them my name
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,50,Tell them how the crowds went wild
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,51,Tell them how I hope they shine
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,52,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,53,"I had the time of my life,with you"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,54,"Long,long live the walls we crashed through"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,55,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,56,I was screaming long live all the magic we made

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,58,I'm not afraid
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,59,"Singing,long live all the mountains we moved"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,60,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,61,"And long,long live that look on your face"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,62,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,14,Long Live,63,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,1,Elevator buttons and morning air
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,2,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,3,If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,4,But right now my time is theirs
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,5,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,6,They'll judge it like they know about me and you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,7,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,15,Ours,8,"The jury's out,but my choice is you"

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,1,Last night I heard my own heart beating
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,2,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,3,Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,4,Even though I know you're not there
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,5,"I was playing back a thousand memories,baby"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,6,Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,7,Maybe I've been going back too much lately
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,8,When time stood still and I had you
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,9,"Come back,come back,come back to me like"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,10,"You would,you would if this was a movie"

Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,19,Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,20,"Now I'm pacing down the hall,chasing down your street"
Taylor Swift,2010/10/25,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,21,Flashback to the night when you said to me

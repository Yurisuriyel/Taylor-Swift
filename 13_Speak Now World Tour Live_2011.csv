Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,1,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,2,And I'm a house of cards
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,3,You're the kinda reckless that should send me run
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,4,But I kinda know that I won't get far
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,5,And you stood there in front of me just
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,6,Close enough to touch
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,7,Close enough to hope you couldn't
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,8,See what I was thinking of
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,9,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,10,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,11,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,12,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,13,Cause I see Sparks Fly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,14,Whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,15,Get me with those green eyes
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,16,Baby as the lights go down
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,17,Give me something that'll haunt me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,18,When you're not around
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,19,Cause I see Sparks Fly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,20,Whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,21,My mind forgets to remind me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,22,You're a bad idea
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,23,You touch me once and it's
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,24,Really something you find I'm even better
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,25,Than you imagined I would be
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,26,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,27,But with you I know it's no good
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,28,And I could wait patiently but
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,29,I really wish you would
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,30,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,31,Meet me in the pouring rain

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,41,Whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,42,I run my fingers through your hair
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,43,And watch the lights go wild
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,44,Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,45,It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,46,And lead me up the staircase
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,47,Won't you whisper soft and slow
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,48,I'm captivated by you baby
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,49,Like a firework show

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,60,Cause I see Sparks Fly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,61,Whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,62,When the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,63,Oh baby smile
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,1,Sparks Fly,64,When the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,1,Oh oh~oh~
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,2,Oh oh~oh~
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,3,You were in college working part time waiting tables
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,4,Left a small town never looked back
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,5,I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,6,Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,7,I say can you believe it?
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,8,As we're lying on the couch
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,9,The moment I could see it
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,10,"Yes, yes I can see it now"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,11,Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,12,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,13,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,14,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,15,Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,16,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,17,You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,18,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,19,"But we got bills to pay, we got nothing figured out"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,20,When it was hard to take
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,21,"Yes, yes, this is what I thought about"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,22,Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,23,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,24,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,25,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,26,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,27,You saw me start to believe for the first time
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,28,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,29,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,30,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 am"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,31,As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,32,I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,33,Braced myself for the goodbye
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,34,Cause that's all I've ever known
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,35,Then you took me by surprise
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,36,You said I'll never leave you alone
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,37,You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,38,"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,39,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,40,She is the best thing that’s ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,41,"Hold on, make it last"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,42,"Hold on, never turn back"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,43,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,44,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,45,"Yes, yes do you believe it?"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,46,"Yes, yes we're gonna make it now"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,47,"Yes, yes I can see it"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,2,Mine,48,I can see it now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,1,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,2,How we met and the sparks flew instantly
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,3,And people would say they're the lucky ones
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,4,I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,5,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,6,Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,7,"Oh, a simple complication,"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,8,miscommunications lead to fall out
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,9,So many things that I wish you knew
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,10,So many walls up I can't break through
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,11,Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,12,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,13,"And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,14,I don't know what to say
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,15,since the twist of fate when it all broke down
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,16,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,17,Next chapter
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,18,How'd we end up this way
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,19,See me nervously pulling at my clothes
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,20,and trying to look busy
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,21,And you're doing your best to avoid me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,22,I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,23,How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,24,But you held your pride like you should've held me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,25,"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,26,why are we pretending this is nothing
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,27,"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,28,I've never heard silence quite this loud
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,29,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,30,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,31,"And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,32,I don't know what to say since
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,33,the twist of fate when it all broke down
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,34,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,35,This is looking like a contest
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,36,of who can act like they care less
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,37,But I liked it better when you were on my side
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,38,The battles in your hands now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,39,But I would lay my armor down
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,40,if you'd say you'd rather love than fight
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,41,So many things that you wish I knew
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,42,But the story of us might be ending soon
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,43,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,44,And we're not speaking

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,48,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,3,The Story of Us,49,The end
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,1,I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,2,In the front seat of his car
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,3,He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,4,The other on my heart
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,5,"I look around, turn the radio down"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,6,He says baby is something wrong?
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,7,I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,8,And he said...
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,9,"Our song is the slamming screen door,"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,10,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,11,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,12,Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,13,Our song is the way you laugh
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,14,"The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,16,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,17,I was walking up the front porch
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,18,steps after everything that day
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,19,Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,20,And lost and thrown away
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,21,"Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,22,I almost didn't notice all the roses
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,23,And the note that said...
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,24,"Our song is the slamming screen door,"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,4,Our Song,25,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,6,"You, picking on the weaker man"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,7,Well you can take me down with just one single blow
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,8,But you don't know what you don't know
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,9,Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,10,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,11,Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,16,"You have pointed out my flaws again,"
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,17,as if I don't already see them
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,18,I walk with my head down
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,19,trying to block you out cause I'll never impress you
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,20,I just wanna feel okay again

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,32,But nobody's listening
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,33,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,34,Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,5,Mean,35,but all you are is mean

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,7,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,8,Somewhere back inside a room
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,9,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,18,Fond gestures are exchanged
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,19,And the organ starts to play a song that
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,20,Sounds like a death march
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,21,And I am hiding in the curtains
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,22,It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,23,She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,43,I am not the kind of girl

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,9,Speak Now,45,But you are not the kind of boy

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,17,Fifteen,43,Who changed his mind
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,17,Fifteen,44,And we both cried

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,26,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,27,But you were everything to me
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,28,I was begging you please don't go
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,29,And I said

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,31,I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,45,My faith in you was fading
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,46,When I met you on the outskirts of town
Taylor Swift,2011/11/21,Speak Now World Tour Live,18,Love Story,47,And I said

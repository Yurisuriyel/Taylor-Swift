Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,1,There's something 'bout the way
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,2,The street looks when it's just rained
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,3,There's a glow off the pavement
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,4,You walk me to the car
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,5,And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,6,"In the middle of the parking lot,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,7,"Oh,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,8,We're driving down the road
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,9,I wonder if you know
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,10,I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,11,But you're just so cool
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,12,Run your hands through your hair
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,13,Absent mindedly making me want you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,14,And I don't know how it gets better than this
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,15,You take my hand and drag me head first
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,16,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,17,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,18,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,19,So baby drive slow
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,20,til we run out of road in this one horse town
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,21,I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,22,You put your eyes on me
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,23,"In this moment now capture it,remember it"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,24,And I don't know how it gets better than this

Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,26,Fearless

Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,28,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,29,Well you stood there with me in the doorway
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,30,"My hands shake,I'm not usually this way but"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,31,You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,32,"It's the first kiss,it's flawless,really something"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,33,It's fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,34,"Oh,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,35,And I don't know how it gets better than this

Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,39,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,40,And I don't know how it gets better than this

Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,42,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,43,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,44,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,45,Oh oh
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,1,Fearless,46,Oh yeah
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,1,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,2,It's the morning of your very first day
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,3,You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,4,Try and stay out of everybody's way
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,5,It's your freshman year and you're going to be here
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,6,For the next four years in this town
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,7,Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,8,"""You know,I haven't seen you around before"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,9,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,10,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,11,And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,12,"Well,count to ten,take it in"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,13,This is life before you know who you're going to be
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,14,Fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,15,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,16,And soon enough you're best friends
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,17,Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,18,We'll be outta here as soon as we can
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,19,And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,20,And you're feeling like flying
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,21,And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,22,And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,23,When the night ends
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,24,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,25,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,26,When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,27,Makes your head spin 'round
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,28,But in your life you'll do things greater than
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,29,Dating the boy on the football team
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,30,But I didn't know it at fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,31,When all you wanted was to be wanted
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,32,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,33,Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,34,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,35,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,36,Who changed his mind and we both cried
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,37,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,38,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,39,"And when you're fifteen,don't forget to look before you fall"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,40,I've found time can heal most anything
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,41,And you just might find who you're supposed to be
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,42,I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,43,La la la la la la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,44,La la la la la la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,45,La la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,46,Your very first day
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,47,Take a deep breath girl
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,2,Fifteen,48,Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,1,We were both young when I first saw you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,2,"I close my eyes,and the flashback starts"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,3,I'm standing there
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,4,On a balcony in summer air
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,5,"See the lights,see the party,the ball gowns"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,6,See you make your way through the crowd
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,7,"And say,""hello"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,8,Little did I know
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,9,"That you were Romeo,you were throwing pebbles"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,10,"And my daddy said,""stay away from Juliet"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,11,And I was crying on the staircase
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,12,"Begging you,""please don't go,"" and I said"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,13,"Romeo,take me somewhere we can be alone"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,14,"I'll be waiting,all there's left to do is run"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,15,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,16,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,17,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,18,"We keep quiet,'cause we're dead if they knew"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,19,So close your eyes
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,20,Escape this town for a little while
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,21,"Cause you were Romeo,I was a scarlet letter"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,22,"And my daddy said,""Stay away from Juliet"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,23,But you were everything to me
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,24,I was begging you please don't go and I said
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,25,"Romeo,take me somewhere we can be alone"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,26,"I'll be waiting,all there's left to do is run"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,27,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,28,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,29,"Romeo,save me,they're trying to tell me how to feel"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,30,"This love is difficult,but it's real"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,31,"Don't be afraid,we'll make it out of this mess"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,32,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,33,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,34,I got tired of waiting
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,35,Wondering if you were ever coming around
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,36,My faith in you was fading
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,37,"When I met you on the outskirts of town,and I said"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,38,Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,39,I keep waiting for you but you never come
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,40,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,41,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,42,"And said: ""Marry me Juliet"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,43,You'll never have to be alone
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,44,I love you and that's all I really know
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,45,"I talked to your dad,go pick out a white dress"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,46,"It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"""
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,47,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,3,Love Story,48,"Oh,oh"

Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,2,But I know I saw a light in you
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,3,And as we walked we were talking
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,4,I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,5,Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Taylor Swift,2008/11/11,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,6,I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

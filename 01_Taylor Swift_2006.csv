Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,2,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,3,"I said,""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,4,Just a boy in a Chevy truck
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,5,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,6,On backroads at night
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,7,And I was right there beside him all summer long
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,8,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,9,But when you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,10,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,11,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,12,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,13,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,14,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,15,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,16,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,17,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,18,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,19,September saw a month of tears
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,20,And thankin' God that you weren't here
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,21,To see me like that
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,22,But in a box beneath my bed
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,23,Is a letter that you never read
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,24,From three summers back
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,25,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,26,"And lookin' back on all of that,it's nice to believe"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,27,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,28,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,29,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,30,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,31,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,32,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,33,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,34,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,35,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,36,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,37,And I'm back for the first time since then
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,38,I'm standin' on your street
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,39,And there's a letter left on your doorstep
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,40,And the first thing that you'll read is:
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,41,"""When you think Tim McGraw"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,42,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,43,Someday you'll turn your radio on
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,44,"I hope it takes you back to that place"""
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,45,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,46,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,47,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,48,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,49,When you think Tim McGraw

Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,21,"I'm alone,on my own,and that's all I know"

Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,10,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,11,And you come away with a great little story
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,12,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,13,"Oh what a shame,what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"

Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,1,I didn't know what I would find
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,2,"When I went looking for a reason,I know"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,3,I didn't read between the lines
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,4,"And,baby,I've got nowhere to go"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,5,I tried to take the road less traveled by
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,6,But nothing seems to work the first few times
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,7,Am I right?

Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,12,I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,13,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,14,"You saw me there,but never knew"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,15,I would give it all up to be
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,16,"A part of this,a part of you"
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,17,And now it's all too late so you see
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,18,You could've helped if you had wanted to
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,19,But no one notices until it's too
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,20,Late to do anything

Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,12,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,1,Friday night beneath the stars
Taylor Swift,2006/10/24,Taylor Swift,12,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,2,In a field behind your yard

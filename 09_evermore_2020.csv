Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,1,I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,2,Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,3,And if it was an open/shut case
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,4,I never would've known from that look on your face
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,5,Lost in your current like a priceless wine
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,6,"The more that you say,the less I know"
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,7,"Wherever you stray,I follow"
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,8,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,9,"Wreck my plans,that's my man"
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,10,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,11,"Head on the pillow,I could feel you sneaking in"
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,12,As if you were a mythical thing
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,13,Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,14,There was one prize I'd cheat to win
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,15,"The more that you say,the less I know"
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,16,"Wherever you stray,I follow"

Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,19,You know that my train could take you home
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,20,Anywhere else is hollow
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,21,I'm begging for you to take my hand

Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,25,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,26,But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,27,Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,28,Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,29,Now this is an open/shut case
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,30,I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,31,Every bait and switch was a work of art
Taylor Swift,2020/12/11,evermore,1,willow,32,"The more that you say,the less I know"

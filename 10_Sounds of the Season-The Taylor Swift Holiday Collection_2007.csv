Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,1,Please take down the misletoe
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,2,Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,3,Cause everything I want is miles away
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,4,In a snow covered little town
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,5,"My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me"
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,6,"Season's greetings, hope you're well"
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,7,Well I'm doing alright
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,8,If you were wondering
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,9,Lately I can never tell
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,10,I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,11,But there were Christmases when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,12,"I've been doing fine without you, really"
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,13,Up until the nights got cold
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,14,"And everybody's here, except you, baby"
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,15,Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,16,But for me it's just a lonely time
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,17,Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,21,And were your cousins late again?
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,22,When you were putting up the lights this year
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,23,Did you notice one less pair of hands?
Taylor Swift,2007/10/14,Sounds of the Season:The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,2,Christmases When You Were Mine,24,I know this shouldn't be a lonely time

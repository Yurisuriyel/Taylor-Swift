Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,3,Lived in the shade you were throwing
Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,4,"Til all of my sunshine was gone,gone,gone"

Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,32,It's just indifference
Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,33,I forgot that you-
Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,34,Sent me a clear message
Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,35,Taught me some hard lessons
Taylor Swift,2019/8/23,Lover,1,I Forgot That You Existed,36,I just forget what they were

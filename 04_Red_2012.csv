Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,1,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,2,Busy streets and busy lives
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,3,And all we know is touch and go
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,4,We are alone with our changing minds
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,5,"We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds,or fades in time"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,6,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,7,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,8,You come around and the armor falls
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,9,Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,10,"Now all we know,is don't let go"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,11,We are alone just you and me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,12,Up in your room and our slates are clean
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,13,"Just twin fire signs,four blue eyes"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,14,So you were never a saint
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,15,And I've loved in shades of wrong
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,16,We learn to live with the pain
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,17,Mosaic broken hearts
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,18,But this love is brave and wild
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,19,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,20,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,21,This is a state of grace
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,22,This is the worthwhile fight
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,23,Love is a ruthless game
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,24,Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,25,These are the hands of fate
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,26,You're my Achilles heel
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,27,This is the golden age of something good
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,28,And right and real
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,29,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,30,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,31,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,32,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,33,This is a state of grace
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,34,This is a worthwhile fight
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,35,Love is a ruthless game
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,1,State of Grace,36,Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,1,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,2,Down a dead-end street
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,3,"Faster than the wind,passionate as sin"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,4,Ending so suddenly
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,5,Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,6,Once you're already flying through the free fall
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,7,"Like the colors in autumn,so bright"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,8,Just before they lose it all
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,9,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,10,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,11,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,12,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,13,Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,14,Was right there in front of you
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,15,Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,16,All the words to your old favorite song
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,17,Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,18,And realizing there's no right answer
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,19,Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,20,That love could be that strong
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,21,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,22,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,23,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,24,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,25,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,26,"Tell myself it's time now,gotta let go"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,27,But moving on from him is impossible
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,28,When I still see it all in my head
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,29,In burning red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,30,Loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,31,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,32,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,33,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,34,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,35,And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,36,"Comes back to me,burning red"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,37,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,2,Red,38,His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,1,Put your lips close to mine
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,2,As long as they don't touch
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,3,"Out of focus,eye to eye"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,4,Till the gravity's too much
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,5,And I'll do anything you say
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,6,If you say it with your hands
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,7,And I'd be smart to walk away
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,8,But you're quick sand
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,9,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,10,This path is reckless
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,11,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,12,And I I I like it
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,13,I can't decide if it's a choice
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,14,Getting swept away
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,15,I hear the sound of my own voice
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,16,Asking you to stay
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,17,And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,18,Forever going with the flow but you're friction
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,19,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,20,This path is reckless
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,21,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,22,And I I I like it
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,23,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,24,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,25,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,26,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,27,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,28,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,29,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,30,This daydream is dangerous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,31,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,32,"And I-I-I,I-I-I,I-I-I"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,33,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,34,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,35,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,36,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,37,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,38,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,39,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,40,This daydream is dangerous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,41,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,42,"I-I-I,I-I-I,I-I-I ..."
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,43,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,44,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,45,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,46,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,47,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,48,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,49,"I'll follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,50,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,3,Treacherous,51,And I-I-I like it
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,1,"Once upon a time,a few mistakes ago"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,2,"I was in your sights,you got me alone"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,3,"You found me,you found me,you found me"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,4,"I guess you didn't care,and I guess I liked that"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,5,"And when I fell hard,you took a step back"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,6,"Without me,without me,without me"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,7,"And he's long gone,when he's next to me"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,8,And I realize the blame is on me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,9,Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,10,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,11,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,12,"Till you put me down,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,13,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,14,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,15,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,16,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,17,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,18,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"

Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,21,"No apologies,he'll never see you cry"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,22,Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,23,"You're drowning,you're drowning"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,24,You're drowning
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,25,"And I heard you moved on,from whispers on the street"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,26,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,27,"And now I see,now I see"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,28,Now I see
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,29,He was long gone when he met me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,30,"And I realize the joke is on me,hey!"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,31,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,32,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,33,Flew me to places I'd never been

Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,37,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,38,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,41,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,42,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,43,"And the saddest fear,comes creeping in"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,44,That you never loved me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,45,"Or her,or anyone,or anything,yeah!"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,46,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,47,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,48,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,49,"Till you put me down,oh"

Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,53,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,54,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,55,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"

Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,57,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,1,"I walked through the door with you,the air was cold"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,2,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,3,Left my scarf there at your sister's house
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,4,"And you've still got it in your drawer,even now"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,5,"Oh,your sweet disposition"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,6,And my wide-eyed gaze
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,7,We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,8,The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,9,And I can picture it after all these days
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,10,"And I know it's long gone,and that magic's not here no more"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,11,"And I might be okay,but I'm not fine at all"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,12,Cause there we are again on that little town street
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,13,You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,14,"Wind in my hair,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,15,Photo album on the counter
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,16,Your cheeks were turning red
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,17,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,18,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,19,You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,20,"And I know it's long gone,and there was nothing else I could do"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,21,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,22,Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,23,We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,24,"Down the stairs,I was there,I remember it all too well,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,25,And maybe we got lost in translation
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,26,Maybe I asked for too much
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,27,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,28,Till you tore it all up
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,29,"Running scared,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,30,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,31,So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,32,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,33,"Cause I remember it all,all,all... too well"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,34,Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,35,I'd like to be my old self again
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,36,But I'm still trying to find it
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,37,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,38,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,39,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,40,Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,41,"You can't get rid of it,'cause you remember it all too well,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012/10/22,Red,5,All Too Well,42,Because there we are again when I loved you so

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,10,Til my dying day
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,11,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,12,And you're the hero flying around saving face
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,13,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,14,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,15,Wishing I stayed
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,16,Look at how my tears ricochet
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,17,We gather stones
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,18,Never knowing what they'll mean
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,19,Some to throw
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,20,Some to make a diamond ring
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,21,You know I didn't want to
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,22,Have to haunt you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,23,But what a ghostly scene
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,24,You wear the same jewels
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,25,That I gave you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,26,As you bury me
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,27,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,28,"Cause when I'd fight,you used to tell me I was brave"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,29,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,30,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,31,Wishing I'd stayed
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,32,Look at how my tears ricochet
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,33,And I can go anywhere I want
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,34,Anywhere I want
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,35,Just not home
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,36,"And you can aim for my heart,go for blood"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,37,But you would still miss me in your bones
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,38,And I still talk to you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,39,When I'm screaming at the sky
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,40,And when you can't sleep at night
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,41,you hear my stolen lullabies
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,42,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,43,And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,44,"You had to kill me,but it killed you just the same"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,45,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,46,Wishing I stayed

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,50,Drunk on this pain
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,51,Crossing out the good years
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,52,And you're cursing my name

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,20,You are not like the regulars
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,21,The masquerade revelers
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,22,Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,23,Hush
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,24,"When no one is around,my dear"

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,32,Shining just for you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,33,And they called off the circus
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,34,Burned the disco down
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,35,When they sent home the horses
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,36,And the rodeo clowns
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,37,I'm still on that tightrope

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,2,I hit my peak at seven Feet
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,3,In the swing Over the creek
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,4,"I was too scared to jump in but I,I was high"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,5,In the sky
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,6,With Pennsylvania under me Are there still beautiful things?
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,7,Sweet tea in the summer
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,8,"Cross your heart,won't tell no other And though I can't recall your face"

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,12,The love lasts so long
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,13,And I've been meaning to tell you I think your house is haunted
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,14,Your dad is always mad and that must be why
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,15,And I think you should come live with me and we can be pirates

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,17,And just like a folk song
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,18,Our love will be passed on
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,19,Please picture me In the weeds
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,20,Before I learned civility I used to scream Ferociously
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,21,Any time I wanted
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,22,Sweet tea in the summer
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,23,"Cross my heart,won't tell no other And though I can't recall your face I still got love for you"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,24,Pack your dolls and a sweater
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,7,Seven,25,We'll move to India forever Passed down like folk songs Our love lasts so long
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,1,Salt air
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,2,And the rust on your door
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,3,I never needed anything more
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,4,Whispers of “are you sure?”
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,5,“Never have I ever before”
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,6,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,7,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,8,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,9,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,10,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,11,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,12,Your back beneath the sun
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,13,Wishing I could write my name on it
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,14,Will you call when you're back at school?
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,15,I remember thinking I had you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,16,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,17,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,18,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,19,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,20,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,21,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,22,Back when we were still changing for the better
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,23,Wanting was enough
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,24,For me it was enough
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,25,To live for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,26,Cancel plans just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,27,And say “meet me behind the mall”
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,28,"So much for summer love,and saying “us”"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,29,Cause you weren't mine to lose
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,30,You weren't mine to lose
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,31,No
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,32,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,33,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,34,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,35,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,36,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,37,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,38,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,39,Never mine
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,40,Do you remember?
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,41,Remember when I pulled up
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,42,And said “get in the car”
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,43,And then canceled my plans
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,44,just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,45,Back when I was living for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,46,"For the hope of it all,“meet me behind the mall”"
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,47,Remember when I pulled up
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,48,And said “get in the car”
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,49,And then canceled my plans
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,50,just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,51,Back when I was living for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,52,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,53,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,54,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,8,august,55,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,1,I've been having a hard time adjusting
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,2,I had the shiniest wheels
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,3,Now they're rusting
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,4,I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,5,I have a lot of regrets about that
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,6,Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,7,Could've followed my fears all the way down
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,8,And maybe I don't quite know what to say
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,9,But I'm here in your doorway
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,10,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,11,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,12,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,13,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,14,They told me all of my cages were mental
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,15,So I got wasted like all my potential
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,16,And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,17,I have a lot of regrets about that
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,18,I was so ahead of the curve
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,19,The curve became a sphere
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,20,Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,21,Pouring out my heart to a stranger
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,22,But I didn't pour the whiskey
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,23,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,24,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,25,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,26,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,27,At least I'm trying
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,28,And it's hard to be at a party
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,29,When I feel like an open wound
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,30,It's hard to be anywhere these days
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,31,When all I want is you
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,32,You're a flashback in a film reel
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,33,On the one screen in my town...
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,34,And I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,35,That this is me trying

Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,3,Keep your eyes down
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,4,Tell your friends you're out for a run
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,5,You'll be flushed when you return
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,6,Take the road less traveled by
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,7,Tell yourself you can always stop
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,8,What started in beautiful rooms
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,9,Ends with meetings in parking lots
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,10,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,11,And clandestine meetings
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,12,And longing stares
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,13,It's born from just one single glance
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,14,But it dies and it dies and it dies
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,15,...a million little times
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,16,Leave the perfume on the shelf
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,17,That you picked out just for him
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,18,So you leave no trace behind
Taylor Swift,2020/7/24,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,19,Like you don't even exist

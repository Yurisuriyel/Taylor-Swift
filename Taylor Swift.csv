Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,2,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,3,"I said,""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,4,Just a boy in a Chevy truck
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,5,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,6,On backroads at night
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,7,And I was right there beside him all summer long
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,8,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,9,But when you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,10,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,11,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,12,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,13,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,14,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,15,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,16,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,17,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,18,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,19,September saw a month of tears
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,20,And thankin' God that you weren't here
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,21,To see me like that
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,22,But in a box beneath my bed
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,23,Is a letter that you never read
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,24,From three summers back
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,25,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,26,"And lookin' back on all of that,it's nice to believe"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,27,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,28,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,29,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,30,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,31,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,32,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,33,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,34,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,35,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,36,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,37,And I'm back for the first time since then
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,38,I'm standin' on your street
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,39,And there's a letter left on your doorstep
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,40,And the first thing that you'll read is:
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,41,"""When you think Tim McGraw"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,42,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,43,Someday you'll turn your radio on
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,44,"I hope it takes you back to that place"""
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,45,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,46,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,47,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,48,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,49,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,50,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,51,"Oh,think of me"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,52,Mmmm
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,53,He said the way my blue eyes shine
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,54,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,55,"I said,""That's a lie"""

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,1,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,2,I fake a smile so he won't see
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,3,That I want and I'm needing
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,4,Everything that we should be

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,9,That I can't even see
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,10,Anyone when he's with me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,11,"He says he's so in love,he's finally got it right"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,12,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,13,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,14,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,15,He's the song in the car
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,16,"I keep singing,don't know why I do..."
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,17,Drew walks by me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,18,Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,19,"And there he goes,so perfectly"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,20,The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,27,"So I drive home alone,as I turn off the light"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,28,I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,29,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,30,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,31,He's the song in the car

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,35,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,3,Teardrops On My Guitar,36,I fake a smile so he won't see
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,1,"I don't know what I want,so don't ask me"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,2,Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,3,"Don't know what's down this road,I'm just walking"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,4,Trying to see through the rain coming down
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,5,Even though I'm not the only one
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,6,Who feels the way I do
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,7,"I'm alone,on my own,and that's all I know"

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,12,"Feeling lucky today,got the sunshine"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,13,Could you tell me what more do I need
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,14,"And tomorrow's just a mystery,oh yeah"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,15,But that's OK
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,16,"I'm alone,on my own,and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,17,"I'll be strong,I'll be wrong,oh but life goes on"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,18,"Oh,I'm just a girl,trying to find a place in this world"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,19,Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,20,But I'm ready to fly
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,21,"I'm alone,on my own,and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,22,"I'll be strong,I'll be wrong,oh but life goes on"

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,26,"Oh I'm just a girl,oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,4,A Place In This World,27,Oh I'm just a girl
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,1,You have a way of coming easily to me
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,2,"And when you take,you take the very best of me"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,3,So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,4,And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,5,"Oh what a shame,what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,6,"Just walk away,no use defending words that you will never say"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,7,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,8,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,9,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,10,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,11,And you come away with a great little story
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,12,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,13,"Oh what a shame,what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,14,"Just walk away,no use defending words that you will never say"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,15,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,16,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,17,"You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried,cried for you"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,18,"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died,died for you"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,19,(Died for you)
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,20,"Oh what a shame,what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,21,Every smile you fake is so condescending
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,22,Counting all the scars you made
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,23,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,5,Cold as You,24,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,1,I didn't know what I would find
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,2,"When I went looking for a reason,I know"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,3,I didn't read between the lines
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,4,"And,baby,I've got nowhere to go"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,5,I tried to take the road less traveled by
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,6,But nothing seems to work the first few times
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,7,Am I right?
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,8,So how can I ever try to be better?
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,9,Nobody ever lets me in
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,10,"I can still see you,this ain't the best view"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,11,On the outside looking in
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,12,I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,13,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,14,"You saw me there,but never knew"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,15,I would give it all up to be
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,16,"A part of this,a part of you"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,17,And now it's all too late so you see
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,18,You could've helped if you had wanted to
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,19,But no one notices until it's too
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,20,Late to do anything
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,21,So how can I ever try to be better?
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,22,Nobody ever lets me in
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,23,"I can still see you,this ain't the best view"

Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,29,"I can still see you,this ain't the best view"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,30,On the outside looking in
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,31,I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,6,The Outside,32,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,1,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,2,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,3,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,4,"But that's not true,'cause I know you"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,5,Hold on
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,6,Baby you're losing it
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,7,The water's high
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,8,You're jumping into it
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,9,And letting go
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,10,And no one knows
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,11,That you cry
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,12,But you don't tell anyone
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,13,That you might
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,14,Not be the golden one
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,15,And you're tied together with a smile
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,16,But you're coming undone
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,17,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,18,Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,19,Hoping it will end up in his pocket
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,20,But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,21,"Oh,'cause it's not his price to pay"
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,22,Not his price to pay
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,23,Hold on
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,24,Baby you're losing it
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,25,The water's high
Taylor Swift,2006,Taylor Swift,7,Tied Together With A Smile,26,You're jumping into it

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,1,There's something 'bout the way
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,2,The street looks when it's just rained
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,3,There's a glow off the pavement

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,11,But you're just so cool
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,12,Run your hands through your hair
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,13,Absent mindedly making me want you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,14,And I don't know how it gets better than this
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,15,You take my hand and drag me head first
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,16,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,17,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,18,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,19,So baby drive slow
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,20,til we run out of road in this one horse town
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,21,I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,22,You put your eyes on me
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,23,"In this moment now capture it,remember it"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,28,Fearless
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,29,Well you stood there with me in the doorway
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,30,"My hands shake,I'm not usually this way but"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,31,You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,32,"It's the first kiss,it's flawless,really something"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,33,It's fearless
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,34,"Oh,yeah"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,45,Oh oh
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,1,Fearless,46,Oh yeah
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,1,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,2,It's the morning of your very first day
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,3,You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,4,Try and stay out of everybody's way
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,5,It's your freshman year and you're going to be here
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,6,For the next four years in this town
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,7,Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,8,"""You know,I haven't seen you around before"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,9,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,10,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,11,And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,12,"Well,count to ten,take it in"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,13,This is life before you know who you're going to be
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,14,Fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,15,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,16,And soon enough you're best friends
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,17,Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,18,We'll be outta here as soon as we can
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,19,And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,20,And you're feeling like flying
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,21,And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,22,And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,23,When the night ends
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,24,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,25,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,26,When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,27,Makes your head spin 'round
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,28,But in your life you'll do things greater than
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,29,Dating the boy on the football team
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,30,But I didn't know it at fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,31,When all you wanted was to be wanted
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,32,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,33,Back then I swore I was going to marry him someday
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,34,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,35,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,36,Who changed his mind and we both cried
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,37,Because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,38,You're going to believe them
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,39,"And when you're fifteen,don't forget to look before you fall"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,40,I've found time can heal most anything
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,41,And you just might find who you're supposed to be
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,42,I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,43,La la la la la la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,44,La la la la la la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,45,La la la la la la
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,46,Your very first day
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,47,Take a deep breath girl
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,2,Fifteen,48,Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,1,We were both young when I first saw you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,2,"I close my eyes,and the flashback starts"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,3,I'm standing there
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,4,On a balcony in summer air
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,5,"See the lights,see the party,the ball gowns"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,6,See you make your way through the crowd
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,7,"And say,""hello"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,8,Little did I know
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,9,"That you were Romeo,you were throwing pebbles"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,10,"And my daddy said,""stay away from Juliet"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,11,And I was crying on the staircase
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,12,"Begging you,""please don't go,"" and I said"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,13,"Romeo,take me somewhere we can be alone"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,14,"I'll be waiting,all there's left to do is run"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,15,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,16,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,17,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,18,"We keep quiet,'cause we're dead if they knew"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,19,So close your eyes
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,20,Escape this town for a little while
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,21,"Cause you were Romeo,I was a scarlet letter"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,22,"And my daddy said,""Stay away from Juliet"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,23,But you were everything to me
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,24,I was begging you please don't go and I said
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,25,"Romeo,take me somewhere we can be alone"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,26,"I'll be waiting,all there's left to do is run"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,27,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,28,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,29,"Romeo,save me,they're trying to tell me how to feel"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,30,"This love is difficult,but it's real"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,31,"Don't be afraid,we'll make it out of this mess"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,32,"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,33,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,34,I got tired of waiting
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,35,Wondering if you were ever coming around
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,36,My faith in you was fading
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,37,"When I met you on the outskirts of town,and I said"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,38,Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,39,I keep waiting for you but you never come
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,40,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,41,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,42,"And said: ""Marry me Juliet"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,43,You'll never have to be alone
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,44,I love you and that's all I really know
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,45,"I talked to your dad,go pick out a white dress"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,46,"It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"""
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,47,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,3,Love Story,48,"Oh,oh"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,1,"Hey Stephen,I know looks can be deceiving"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,2,But I know I saw a light in you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,3,And as we walked we were talking
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,4,I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,5,Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,6,I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,7,"Hey Stephen,boy,you might have me believing"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,8,I don't always have to be alone
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,9,Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,15,So I got some things to say to you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,16,"I've seen it all,so I thought"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,4,Hey Stephen,17,But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,4,I couldn't ask for anything better
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,5,He opens up my door and I get into his car
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,6,And he says you look beautiful tonight
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,7,And I feel perfectly fine
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,8,But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,9,And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,10,You're so in love that you act insane
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,11,And that's the way I loved you

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,18,And he calls exactly when he says he will
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,19,He's close to my mother
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,20,Talks business with my father
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,21,He's charming and endearing
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,22,And I'm comfortable
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,23,He can't see the smile I'm faking
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,24,And my heart's not breaking
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,25,Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,10,The Way I Loved You,26,And you were wild and crazy

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,2,I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,3,And we caught onto something
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,4,"I hold onto the night,you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,11,"And I stare at the phone,he still hasn't called"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,12,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,13,And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,14,"Oh,and it rains in your bedroom"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,19,"Did I say something way too honest,made you run and hide"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,20,Like a scared little boy
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,21,I looked into your eyes
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,22,"Thought I knew you for a minute,now I'm not so sure"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,23,So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,24,Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,11,Forever & Always,25,Where is this going?

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,2,"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you,I run and run"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,3,Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,4,"Look now,the sky is gold"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,5,I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,6,I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,7,But I know you're not scared of anything at all

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,12,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,13,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,14,And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,15,I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,12,The Best Day,16,But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,17,Come In With The Rain,25,But I'll leave my window open

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,1,This is wrong but I can't help but feel like there ain't nothin' more right babe
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,2,Misty morning comes again and I can't help but wish I could see your face
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,3,"And I knew from the first note played,I'd be breaking all my rules to see you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,4,You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,5,"So dim that spotlight,tell me things like I can't take my eyes off of you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,6,"I'm no one special,just another wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,7,Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,8,Superstar
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,9,Morning loneliness comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,10,When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,11,And I knew when I saw your face I'd be counting down the ways to see you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,12,And you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,13,"So dim that spotlight,tell me things like I can't take my eyes off of you"

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,16,Superstar
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,17,"You played in bars,you play guitar"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,18,And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,19,And you'll never see you sing me to sleep
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,18,SuperStar,20,Every night on the radio

Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,1,"In the heat of the fight,I walked away"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,2,Ignoring words that you were saying... trying to make me stay
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,3,"I said this time,I've had enough"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,4,And you've called a hundred times...but I'm not picking up
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,5,"Cause I'm so mad,I might tell you that it's over"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,6,But if you look a little closer
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,7,"I said leave,but all I really want is you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,8,To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,9,Screaming I'm in love with you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,10,Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,11,"And don't you leave,cause I knowall I need"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,12,Ison the other side of the door
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,13,Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,14,"Going through the photographs,staring at the phone"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,15,I keep going back over things we both said
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,16,And I remember the slamming door
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,17,And all the things that I misread
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,18,"So babe,if you know everything,tell me why you couldn't see"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,19,When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,20,"I said leave,but all I really want is you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,21,To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,22,Screaming I'm in love with you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,23,Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,24,"And don't you leave,cause I knowall I need"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,25,Ison the other side of the door
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,26,And I'll scream out the window...I can't even look at you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,27,"I don't need you,but I do,I do,I do"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,28,I'll say there's nothing you can say
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,29,To make this right again...I mean it...I mean it
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,30,What I mean is
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,31,"I said ;eave,but baby all I want is you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,32,To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,33,Screaming I'm in love with you
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,34,Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,35,"And don't you leave,cause I know all I need"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,36,Is on the other side of the door
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,37,With your face and the beautiful eyes
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,38,And the conversation with the little white lies
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,39,"And the faded picture of a beautiful night,you"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,40,Carried me from your car up the stairs
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,41,"And I broke down crying,was she worth this mess"
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,42,After everything and that little black dress
Taylor Swift,2008,Fearless,19,The Other Side of the Door,43,After everything I must confess...I need you...I need you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,1,"You were in college,working part-time,waiting tables"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,2,Left a small town and never looked back
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,3,"I was a flight risk,with a fear of falling"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,4,"Wondering why we bother with love,if it never lasts"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,5,"I say,""Can you believe it?"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,6,As we're lying on the couch
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,7,"The moment,I could see it"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,8,"Yes,yes,I can see it now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,9,"Do you remember,we were sitting there,by the water?"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,10,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,11,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,12,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,13,"Flash forward,and we're taking on the world together"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,14,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,15,You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,16,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,17,But we got bills to pay
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,18,We got nothing figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,19,When it was hard to take
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,20,"Yes,yes"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,21,This is what I thought about:
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,22,"Do you remember,we were sitting there,by the water?"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,23,You put your arm around me for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,24,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,25,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,26,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,27,You saw me start to believe for the first time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,28,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,29,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,30,"And I remember that fight,2:30 AM"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,31,As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,32,"I ran out,crying,and you followed me out into the street"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,33,Braced myself for the goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,34,Cause that's all I've ever known
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,35,"Then,you took me by surprise"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,36,"You said,""I'll never leave you alone."""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,37,"You said,""I remember how we felt,sitting by the water"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,38,"And every time I look at you,it's like the first time"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,39,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,40,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,41,"Hold on,make it last"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,42,"Hold on,never turn back"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,43,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,44,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,45,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,46,Do you believe it?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,47,(Hold on)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,48,We're gonna make it now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,49,(Hold on)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,50,And I can see it
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,51,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,1,Mine,52,I can see it now (see it now)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,1,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,2,And I'm a house of cards
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,3,You're the kind of reckless
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,4,That should send me running
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,5,But I kinda know that I won't get far
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,6,And you stood there in front of me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,7,Just close enough to touch
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,8,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,9,What I was thinking of
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,10,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,11,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,12,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,13,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,14,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,15,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,16,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,17,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,18,My mind forgets to remind me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,19,You're a bad idea
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,20,You touch me once and it's really something
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,21,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,22,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,23,But with you I know it's no good
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,24,And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,25,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,26,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,27,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,28,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,29,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,30,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,31,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,32,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,33,I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,34,"Just keep on keeping your eyes on me,it's just wrong enough to make it feel right"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,35,And lead me up the staircase
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,36,Won't you whisper soft and slow?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,37,"I'm captivated by you,baby,like a firework show"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,38,Drop everything now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,39,Meet me in the pouring rain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,40,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,41,Take away the pain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,42,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,43,"Get me with those green eyes,baby,as the lights go down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,44,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,45,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,46,And the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,47,"Oh,baby,smile"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,2,Sparks Fly,48,And the sparks fly
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,1,I'm so glad you made time to see me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,2,"How's life,tell me,how's your family"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,3,I haven't seen them in a while
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,4,"You've been good,busier than ever"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,5,"We small talk,work and the weather"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,6,Your guard is up and I know why
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,7,Cause the last time you saw me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,8,Is still burned in the back of your mind
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,9,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,10,So this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,11,"Standing in front of you,saying I'm sorry for that night"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,12,And I'd go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,13,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,14,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,15,"I'd go back to December,turn around and make it alright"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,16,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,17,These days I haven't been sleeping
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,18,Staying up playing back myself leaving
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,19,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,20,"And I think about summer,all the beautiful times"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,21,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,22,Realized I loved you in the fall
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,23,And then the cold came
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,24,The dark days when fear crept into my mind
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,25,You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,26,So this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,27,"Standing in front of you,saying I'm sorry for that night"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,28,And I'd go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,29,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,30,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,31,"I'd go back to December,turn around and change my own mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,32,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,33,"I miss your tan skin,your sweet smile,so good to me,so right"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,34,And how you held me in your arms that September night
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,35,The first time you ever saw me cry
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,36,Maybe this is wishful thinking
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,37,Probably mindless dreaming
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,38,But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,39,"I'd go back in time and change it,but I can't"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,40,"So if the chain is on your door,I understand"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,41,But this is me swallowing my pride
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,42,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,43,And I'd go back to December...
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,44,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,45,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,46,"I'd go back to December,turn around and make it alright"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,47,"I'd go back to December,turn around and change my own mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,48,I go back to December all the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,3,Back To December,49,All the time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,1,I am not the kind of girl
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,2,Who should be rudely barging in
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,3,On a white veil occasion
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,4,But you are not the kind of boy
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,5,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,6,I sneak in and see your friends
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,7,And her snotty little family
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,8,All dressed in pastel
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,9,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,10,Somewhere back inside a room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,11,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,12,This is surely not
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,13,What you thought it would be
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,14,I lose myself in a daydream
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,15,Where I stand and say
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,16,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,17,I'll meet you when you're out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,18,Of the church at the back door
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,19,Don't wait or say a single vow
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,20,You need to hear me out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,21,"And they said ""speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,22,Fond gestures are exchanged
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,23,And the organ starts to play
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,24,A song that sounds like a death march
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,25,And I am hiding in the curtains
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,26,It seems that I was uninvited
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,27,By your lovely bride-to-be
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,28,She floats down the aisle
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,29,Like a pageant queen
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,30,But I know you wish it was me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,31,You wish it was me (Don't you)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,32,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,33,I'll meet you when you're out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,34,Of the church at the back door
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,35,Don't wait or say a single vow
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,36,You need to hear me out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,37,"And they said ""speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,38,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,39,I'll meet you when you're out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,40,Of the church at the back door
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,41,Don't wait or say a single vow
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,42,You need to hear me out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,43,"And they said ""speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,44,"Ooh,la-da-da-da,oh"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,45,"Ooh,ooh"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,46,(Say a single vow)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,47,I hear the preacher say
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,48,"""Speak now or forever hold your peace"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,49,"There's the silence,there's my last chance"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,50,"I stand up with shaking hands,all eyes on me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,51,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,52,But I'm only looking at you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,53,I am not the kind of girl
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,54,Who should be rudely barging in
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,55,On a white veil occasion
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,56,But you are not the kind of boy
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,57,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,58,(Hehe!)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,59,"Don't say yes,run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,60,I'll meet you when you're out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,61,Of the church at the back door
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,62,Don't wait or say a single vow
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,63,You need to hear me out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,64,"And they said ""speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,65,And you say
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,66,"""Let's run away now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,67,I'll meet you when
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,68,"I'm out of my tux at the back door"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,69,"Baby,I didn't say my vows"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,70,So glad you were around when they said
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,4,Speak Now,71,"""Speak now"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,1,Long were the nights when
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,2,My days once revolved around you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,3,Counting my footsteps
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,4,Praying the floor won't fall through... again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,5,My mother accused me of losing my mind
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,6,But I swore I was fine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,7,You paint me a blue sky
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,8,Then go back and turn it to rain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,9,And I lived in your chess game
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,10,But you changed the rules everyday
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,11,"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone,tonight"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,12,Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,13,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,14,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,15,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,16,I shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,17,Well maybe it's me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,18,And my blind optimism to blame
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,19,Or maybe it's you and your sick need
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,20,To give love and take it away
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,21,And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,22,Who don't understand
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,23,And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,24,"""Run as fast as you can"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,25,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,26,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,27,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,28,"Dear John,I see it all now it was wrong"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,29,Don't you think nineteen's too young
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,30,"To be played by your dark,twisted games"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,31,When I loved you so?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,32,I shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,33,You are an expert at sorry
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,34,And keeping the lines blurry
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,35,Never impressed by me acing your tests
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,36,All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,37,Cause you burned them out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,38,But I took your matches
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,39,Before fire could catch me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,40,So don't look now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,41,I'm shining like fireworks
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,42,"Over your sad empty town,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,43,"Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,44,"Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,45,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,46,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,47,I see it all now that you're gone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,48,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,49,The girl in the dress
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,50,"Wrote you a song,you shoulda' known"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,51,You shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,52,Don't you think I was too young
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,5,Dear John,53,You shoulda' known
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,1,"You,with your words like knives"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,2,And swords and weapons that you use against me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,3,You have knocked me off my feet again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,4,Got me feeling like I'm nothing
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,5,"You,with your voice like nails on a chalkboard"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,6,Calling me out when I'm wounded
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,7,"You,picking on the weaker man"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,8,But you can take me down with just one single blow
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,9,But you don't know what you don't know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,10,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,11,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,12,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,13,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,14,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,15,"You,with your switching sides"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,16,And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,17,You have pointed out my flaws again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,18,As if I don't already see them
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,19,"I walk with my head down,trying to block you out"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,20,Cause I'll never impress you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,21,I just want to feel okay again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,22,I bet you got pushed around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,23,Somebody made you cold
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,24,But the cycle ends right now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,25,Cause you can't lead me down that road
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,26,And you don't know what you don't know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,27,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,28,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,29,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,30,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,31,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,32,And I can see you years from now in a bar
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,33,Talking over a football game
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,34,With that same big loud opinion
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,35,But nobody's listening
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,36,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,37,Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,38,But all you are is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,39,All you are is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,40,"And a liar,and pathetic,and alone in life"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,41,"And mean,and mean,and mean,and mean"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,42,But someday I'll be living in a big old city
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,43,"And all you're ever going to be is mean,yeah!"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,44,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,45,And all you're ever going to be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,46,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,47,"Someday,I'll be living in a big old city"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,48,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,49,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,50,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,51,"Someday,I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,52,(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,53,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,6,Mean,54,Why you gotta be so mean?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,1,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,2,How we met
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,3,And the sparks flew instantly
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,4,And people would say they're the lucky ones
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,5,I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,6,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,7,Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,8,"Oh,a simple complication"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,9,Miscommunications lead to fallout
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,10,So many things that I wish you knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,11,So many walls up that I can't break through
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,12,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,13,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,14,And I'm dying to know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,15,Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,16,"Yeah,I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,when it all broke down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,17,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,18,Next chapter
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,19,How'd we end up this way?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,20,See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,21,And you're doing your best to avoid me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,22,I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,23,Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,24,But you held your pride like you should have held me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,25,"Oh,I'm scared to see the ending"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,26,Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,27,"I'd tell you I miss you,but I don't know how"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,28,I've never heard silence quite this loud
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,29,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,30,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,31,And I'm dying to know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,32,Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,33,"Yeah,and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,when it all broke down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,34,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,35,This is looking like a contest
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,36,Of who can act like they care less
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,37,But I liked it better when you were on my side
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,38,The battle's in your hands now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,39,But I would lay my armor down
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,40,If you say you'd rather love than fight
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,41,So many things that you wish I knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,42,But the story of us might be ending soon
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,43,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,44,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,45,And I'm dying to know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,46,Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,47,"Yeah,and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,when it all broke down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,48,"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,now,now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,49,And we're not speaking
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,50,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,51,Yeah
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,52,"And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,because we're going down"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,53,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,7,The Story of Us,54,The End
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,1,Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,2,And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,3,Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,4,"So I tuck you in,turn on your favorite night light"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,5,"To you everything's funny,you got nothing to regret"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,6,"I'd give all I have,honey"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,7,If you could stay like that
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,8,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,9,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,10,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,11,"Don't you ever grow up,it could stay this simple"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,12,"I won't let nobody hurt you,won't let no one break your heart"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,13,And no one will desert you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,14,"Just try to never grow up,never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,15,You're in the car on the way to the movies
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,16,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,17,At 14 there's just so much you can't do
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,18,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,19,But don't make her drop you off around the block
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,20,Remember that she's getting older too
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,21,And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,22,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,23,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,24,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,25,"Don't you ever grow up,it could stay this simple"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,26,"No one's ever burned you,nothing's ever left you scarred"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,27,"And even though you want to,just try to never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,28,Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,29,Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,30,"Remember the footsteps,remember the words said"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,31,And all your little brother's favorite songs
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,32,I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,33,So here I am in my new apartment
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,34,"In a big city,they just dropped me off"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,35,It's so much colder that I thought it would be
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,36,So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,37,Wish I'd never grown up
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,38,I wish I'd never grown up
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,39,"Oh I don't wanna grow up,wish I'd never grown up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,40,I could still be little
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,41,"Oh I don't wanna grow up,wish I'd never grown up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,42,It could still be simple
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,43,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,44,"Don't you ever grow up,just stay this little"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,45,"Oh darling,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,46,"Don't you ever grow up,it could stay this simple"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,47,Won't let nobody hurt you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,48,Won't let no one break your heart
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,49,"And even though you want to,please try to never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,50,"Oh,don't you ever grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,51,"Oh,never grow up,just never grow up"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,1,There I was again tonight
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,2,"Forcing laughter,faking smiles"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,3,"Same old tired,lonely place"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,4,"Walls of insincerity,shifting eyes and vacancy"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,5,Vanished when I saw your face
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,6,All I can say is
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,7,It was enchanting to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,8,"Your eyes whispered ""have we met?"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,9,Across the room your silhouette
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,10,Starts to make its way to me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,11,The playful conversation starts
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,12,Counter all your quick remarks
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,13,Like passing notes in secrecy
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,14,And it was
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,15,Enchanting to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,16,All I can say is
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,17,I was enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,18,This night is sparkling
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,19,Don't you let it go
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,20,I'm wonderstruck
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,21,Blushing all the way home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,22,I'll spend forever
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,23,Wondering if you knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,24,I was enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,25,The lingering question kept me up
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,26,"2AM,who do you love?"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,27,I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,28,And now I'm pacing back and forth
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,29,Wishing you were at my door
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,30,"I'd open up and you would say ""hey"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,31,It was
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,32,Enchanting to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,33,All I know is I was
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,34,Enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,35,This night is sparkling

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,46,Wondering if you knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,47,I was enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,48,This is me praying that
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,49,This was the very first page
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,50,Not where the storyline ends
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,51,My thoughts will echo your name
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,52,Until I see you again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,53,These are the words I held back
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,54,As I was leaving too soon
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,55,I was enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,56,Please don't be in love
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,57,With someone else
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,58,Please don't have somebody
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,59,Waiting on you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,60,Please don't be in love
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,61,With someone else

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,67,Blushing all the way home
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,68,I'll spend forever
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,69,Wondering if you knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,70,This night is flawless
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,71,Don't you let it go
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,72,I'm wonderstruck
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,73,Dancing around all alone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,74,I'll spend forever
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,75,Wondering if you knew
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,76,I was enchanted to meet you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,77,Please don't be in love
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,78,With someone else
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,79,Please don't have somebody
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,9,Enchanted,80,Waiting on you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,1,Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,2,"Ha,time for a little revenge"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,3,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,4,"I had it all,I had him right there,where I wanted him"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,5,"She came along,got him alone,and let's hear the applause"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,6,She took him faster than you can say sabotage
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,7,"I never saw it coming,wouldn't have suspected it"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,8,I underestimated just who I was dealing with
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,9,She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,10,She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,11,She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,12,"She's an actress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,13,She's better known for the things that she does
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,14,"On the mattress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,15,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,16,On the playground won't make you many friends
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,17,"She should keep in mind,she should keep in mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,18,"There is nothing I do better than revenge,ha!"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,19,She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,20,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,21,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,22,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,23,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,24,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,25,"Oh,they didn't teach you that in prep school,so it's up to me"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,26,But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,27,She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,28,"She's an actress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,29,She's better known for the things that she does
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,30,"On the mattress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,31,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,32,On the playground won't make you many friends
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,33,"She should keep in mind,she should keep in mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,34,"There is nothing I do better than revenge,HA!"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,35,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at,honey"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,36,"You might have him,but haven't you heard?"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,37,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at,honey"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,38,"You might have him,but I always get the last word"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,39,"Whoa,whoa-ah-oh"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,40,She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,41,"She's an actress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,42,She's better known for the things that she does
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,43,"On the mattress,whoa"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,44,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,45,On the playground won't make you many friends
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,46,"She should keep in mind,she should keep in mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,47,"There is nothing I do better than revenge,HA!"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,48,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,49,"Cause I don't think you do,oh"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,50,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,51,"I don't think you do,I don't think you do"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,52,Let's hear the applause
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,53,"Come on,show me how much better you are (so much better,yeah?)"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,54,See you deserve some applause
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,55,Cause you're so much better
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,56,She took him faster than you could say sabotage
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,1,I guess you really did it this time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,2,Left yourself in your warpath
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,3,Lost your balance on a tightrope
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,4,Lost your mind trying to get it back
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,5,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,6,Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,7,Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,8,And everybody believed in you?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,9,"It's alright,just wait and see"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,10,Your string of lights is still bright to me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,11,"Oh,who you are is not where you've been"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,12,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,13,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,14,Did some things you can't speak of
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,15,But at night you live it all again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,16,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,17,If only you had seen what you know now then
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,18,Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,19,"When everything out of reach,someone bigger brought down to you"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,20,Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,21,Before the monsters caught up to you?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,22,"It's alright,just wait and see"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,23,Your string of lights is still bright to me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,24,Ohwho you are is not where you've been
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,25,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,26,"It's okay,life is a tough crowd"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,27,"32,and still growing up now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,28,Who you are is not what you did
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,29,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,30,Time turns flames to embers
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,31,You'll have new Septembers
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,32,Every one of us has messed up too
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,33,Lives change like the weather
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,34,I hope you remember
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,35,Today is never too late to be brand new
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,36,"It's alright,just wait and see"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,37,Your string of lights is still bright to me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,38,"Oh,who you are is not where you've been"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,39,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,40,"It's okay,life is a tough crowd"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,41,"32,and still growing up now"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,42,Who you are is not what you did
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,43,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,44,You're still an innocent
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,45,Lost your balance on a tightrope
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,11,Innocent,46,It's never too late to get it back
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,1,You and I walk a fragile line
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,2,I have known it all this time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,3,But I never thought I'd live to see it break
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,4,It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,5,And I can't trust anything now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,6,And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,7,"Whoa,holding my breath"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,8,Won't lose you again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,9,Something's made your eyes go cold
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,10,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,11,I thought I had you figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,12,Something's gone terribly wrong
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,13,You're all I wanted
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,14,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,15,I thought I had you figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,16,Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,17,Can't turn back now I'm haunted
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,18,Stood there and watched you walk away
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,19,From everything we had
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,20,But I still mean every word I said to you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,21,He will try to take away my pain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,22,And he just might make me smile
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,23,But the whole time I'm wishing it was you instead
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,24,"Oh,holding my breath"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,25,Won't see you again
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,26,Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,27,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,28,I thought I had you figured out

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,30,You're all I wanted
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,31,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,32,I thought I had you figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,33,Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,34,Can't turn back now I'm haunted
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,35,I know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,36,I know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,37,I just know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,38,"You're not gone,you can't be gone,no"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,39,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,40,I thought I had you figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,41,Something's gone terribly wrong
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,42,Won't finish what you started
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,43,"C'mon,c'mon,don't leave me like this"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,44,I thought I had you figured out
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,45,Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,46,Can't turn back now I'm haunted
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,47,(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,48,You and I walk a fragile line
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,49,I have known it all this time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,50,Never ever thought I'd see it break
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,12,Haunted,51,Never thought I'd see it
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,1,I still remember the look on your face
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,2,Lit through the darkness at 1:58
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,3,The words that you whispered
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,4,For just us to know
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,5,You told me you loved me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,6,So why did you go away?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,7,Away
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,8,I do recall now the smell of the rain
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,9,Fresh on the pavement
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,10,I ran off the plane
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,11,That July 9th
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,12,The beat of your heart
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,13,It jumps through your shirt
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,14,I can still feel your arms
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,15,But now I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,16,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,17,All that I know is
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,18,I don't know how to be something you miss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,19,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,20,Never imagined we'd end like this
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,21,"Your name,forever the name on my lips"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,22,I do remember the swing of your step
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,23,"The life of the party,you're showing off again"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,24,And I roll my eyes and then
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,25,You pull me in
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,26,I'm not much for dancing
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,27,But for you I did
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,28,"Because I love your handshake,meeting my father"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,29,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,30,How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,31,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,32,But now I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,33,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,34,All that I know is
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,35,I don't know how to be something you miss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,36,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,37,Never imagined we'd end like this
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,38,"Your name,forever the name on my lips"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,39,So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,40,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,41,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,42,Hope it's nice where you are
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,43,And I hope the sun shines
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,44,And it's a beautiful day
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,45,And something reminds you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,46,You wish you had stayed
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,47,You can plan for a change in weather and time
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,48,But I never planned on you changing your mind
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,49,So I'll go sit on the floor
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,50,Wearing your clothes
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,51,All that I know is
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,52,I don't know how to be something you miss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,53,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,54,Never imagined we'd end like this
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,55,"Your name,forever the name on my lips"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,56,Just like our last kiss
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,57,Forever the name on my lips
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,58,Forever the name on my lips
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,59,Just like our last
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,1,"I said remember this moment,in the back of my mind"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,2,The time we stood with our shaking hands
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,3,The crowds in the stands went wild
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,4,We were the Kings and the Queens
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,5,And they read off our names
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,6,The night you danced like you knew our lives
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,7,Would never be the same
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,8,You held your head like a hero
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,9,On a history book page
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,10,It was the end of a decade
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,11,But the start of an age
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,12,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,13,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,14,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,15,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,16,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,17,I said remember this feeling
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,18,I passed the pictures around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,19,Of all the years that we stood there
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,20,On the side-lines wishing for right now
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,21,We are the Kings and the Queens
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,22,You traded your baseball cap for a crown
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,23,When they gave us our trophies
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,24,And we held them up for our town
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,25,And the cynics were outraged
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,26,"Screaming ""this is absurd"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,27,Cause for a moment a band of thieves
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,28,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,29,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,30,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,31,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,32,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,33,I'm not afraid
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,34,Long live all the mountains we moved
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,35,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,36,I was screaming long live that look on your face
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,37,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,38,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,39,Hold on to spinning around
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,40,Confetti falls to the ground
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,41,May these memories break our fall
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,42,Will you take a moment?
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,43,Promise me this
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,44,That you'll stand by me forever
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,45,But if God forbid fate should step in
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,46,And force us into a goodbye
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,47,If you have children some day
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,48,When they point to the pictures
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,49,Please tell them my name
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,50,Tell them how the crowds went wild
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,51,Tell them how I hope they shine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,52,Long live the walls we crashed through
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,53,"I had the time of my life,with you"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,54,"Long,long live the walls we crashed through"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,55,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,56,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,57,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,58,I'm not afraid
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,59,"Singing,long live all the mountains we moved"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,60,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,61,"And long,long live that look on your face"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,62,And bring on all the pretenders
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,14,Long Live,63,"One day,we will be remembered"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,1,Elevator buttons and morning air
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,2,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,3,If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,4,But right now my time is theirs
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,5,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,6,They'll judge it like they know about me and you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,7,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,8,"The jury's out,but my choice is you"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,9,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,10,People throw rocks at things that shine
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,11,And life makes love look hard
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,12,"The stakes are high,the water's rough"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,13,But this love is ours
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,14,You never know what people have up their sleeves
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,15,Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,16,Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,17,But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,23,But this love is ours
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,24,And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,25,"And your hands are tough,but they are where mine belong"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,26,And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,27,With this song for you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,28,Cause I love the gap between your teeth

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,39,"The stakes are high,the water's rough"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,15,Ours,40,But this love is ours
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,1,Last night I heard my own heart beating
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,2,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,3,Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,4,Even though I know you're not there
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,5,"I was playing back a thousand memories,baby"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,6,Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,7,Maybe I've been going back too much lately
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,8,When time stood still and I had you
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,9,"Come back,come back,come back to me like"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,10,"You would,you would if this was a movie"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,11,Stand in the rain outside till I came out

Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,16,I know people change and these things happen
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,17,But I remember how it was back then
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,18,Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,19,Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,20,"Now I'm pacing down the hall,chasing down your street"
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,21,Flashback to the night when you said to me
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,22,"""Nothing's gonna change,not for me and you"""
Taylor Swift,2010,Speak Now,16,If This Was a Movie,23,Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,2,Busy streets and busy lives
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,3,And all we know is touch and go
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,4,We are alone with our changing minds
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,5,"We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds,or fades in time"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,6,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,7,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,8,You come around and the armor falls
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,9,Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,10,"Now all we know,is don't let go"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,11,We are alone just you and me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,12,Up in your room and our slates are clean
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,13,"Just twin fire signs,four blue eyes"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,14,So you were never a saint
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,15,And I've loved in shades of wrong
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,16,We learn to live with the pain
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,17,Mosaic broken hearts
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,18,But this love is brave and wild
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,19,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,20,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,21,This is a state of grace
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,22,This is the worthwhile fight
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,23,Love is a ruthless game
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,24,Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,25,These are the hands of fate
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,26,You're my Achilles heel
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,27,This is the golden age of something good
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,28,And right and real
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,29,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,30,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,31,And I never saw you coming
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,32,And I'll never be the same
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,33,This is a state of grace
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,34,This is a worthwhile fight
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,35,Love is a ruthless game
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,1,State of Grace,36,Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,1,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,2,Down a dead-end street
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,3,"Faster than the wind,passionate as sin"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,4,Ending so suddenly
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,5,Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,6,Once you're already flying through the free fall
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,7,"Like the colors in autumn,so bright"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,8,Just before they lose it all
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,9,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,10,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,11,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,12,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,13,Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,14,Was right there in front of you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,15,Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,16,All the words to your old favorite song
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,17,Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,18,And realizing there's no right answer
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,19,Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,20,That love could be that strong
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,21,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,22,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,23,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,24,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,25,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,26,"Tell myself it's time now,gotta let go"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,27,But moving on from him is impossible
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,28,When I still see it all in my head
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,29,In burning red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,30,Loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,31,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,32,"Missing him was dark grey,all alone"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,33,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,34,But loving him was red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,35,And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,36,"Comes back to me,burning red"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,37,"Yeah,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,2,Red,38,His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,1,Put your lips close to mine
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,2,As long as they don't touch
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,3,"Out of focus,eye to eye"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,4,Till the gravity's too much
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,5,And I'll do anything you say
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,6,If you say it with your hands
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,7,And I'd be smart to walk away
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,8,But you're quick sand
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,9,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,10,This path is reckless
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,11,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,12,And I I I like it
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,13,I can't decide if it's a choice
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,14,Getting swept away
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,15,I hear the sound of my own voice
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,16,Asking you to stay
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,17,And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,18,Forever going with the flow but you're friction
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,19,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,20,This path is reckless
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,21,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,22,And I I I like it
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,23,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,24,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,25,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,26,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,27,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,28,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,29,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,30,This daydream is dangerous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,31,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,32,"And I-I-I,I-I-I,I-I-I"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,33,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,34,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,35,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,36,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,37,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,38,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,39,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,40,This daydream is dangerous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,41,This hope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,42,"I-I-I,I-I-I,I-I-I ..."
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,43,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,44,And I will get you get you alone
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,45,Your name has echoed through my mind
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,46,And I just think you should think you should know
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,47,That nothing safe is worth the drive
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,48,"And I will follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,49,"I'll follow you follow you home,follow you follow you home"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,50,This slope is treacherous
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,3,Treacherous,51,And I-I-I like it
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,1,"Once upon a time,a few mistakes ago"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,2,"I was in your sights,you got me alone"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,3,"You found me,you found me,you found me"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,4,"I guess you didn't care,and I guess I liked that"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,5,"And when I fell hard,you took a step back"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,6,"Without me,without me,without me"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,7,"And he's long gone,when he's next to me"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,8,And I realize the blame is on me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,9,Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,10,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,11,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,12,"Till you put me down,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,13,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,14,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,15,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,16,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,17,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,18,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,19,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,20,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,21,"No apologies,he'll never see you cry"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,22,Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,23,"You're drowning,you're drowning"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,24,You're drowning
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,25,"And I heard you moved on,from whispers on the street"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,26,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,27,"And now I see,now I see"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,28,Now I see
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,29,He was long gone when he met me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,30,"And I realize the joke is on me,hey!"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,31,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,32,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,33,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,34,"Till you put me down,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,35,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,36,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,37,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,38,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,39,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,40,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,41,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,42,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,43,"And the saddest fear,comes creeping in"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,44,That you never loved me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,45,"Or her,or anyone,or anything,yeah!"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,46,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,47,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,48,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,49,"Till you put me down,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,50,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,51,So shame on me now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,52,Flew me to places I'd never been
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,53,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,54,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,55,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,56,"Oh,oh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,4,I Knew You Were Trouble,57,"Trouble,trouble,trouble"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,1,"I walked through the door with you,the air was cold"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,2,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,3,Left my scarf there at your sister's house
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,4,"And you've still got it in your drawer,even now"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,5,"Oh,your sweet disposition"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,6,And my wide-eyed gaze
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,7,We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,8,The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,9,And I can picture it after all these days
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,10,"And I know it's long gone,and that magic's not here no more"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,11,"And I might be okay,but I'm not fine at all"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,12,Cause there we are again on that little town street
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,13,You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,14,"Wind in my hair,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,15,Photo album on the counter
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,16,Your cheeks were turning red
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,17,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,18,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,19,You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,20,"And I know it's long gone,and there was nothing else I could do"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,21,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,22,Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,23,We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,24,"Down the stairs,I was there,I remember it all too well,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,25,And maybe we got lost in translation
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,26,Maybe I asked for too much
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,27,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,28,Till you tore it all up
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,29,"Running scared,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,30,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,31,So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,32,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,33,"Cause I remember it all,all,all... too well"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,34,Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,35,I'd like to be my old self again
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,36,But I'm still trying to find it
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,37,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,38,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,39,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,40,Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,41,"You can't get rid of it,'cause you remember it all too well,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,42,Because there we are again when I loved you so
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,43,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,44,"It was rare,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,45,"Wind in my hair,you were there,you remember it all"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,46,"Down the stairs,you were there,you remember it all"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,5,All Too Well,47,"It was rare,I was there,I remember it all too well"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,1,It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,2,"And make fun of our exes,uh uh,uh uh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,3,It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,4,"To fall in love with strangers,uh uh,uh uh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,5,Yeah
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,6,"We're happy,free,confused,and lonely at the same time"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,7,"It's miserable and magical,oh yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,8,Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,9,"It's time,uh uh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,10,"I don't know about you,but I'm feeling 22"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,11,Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,12,"You don't know about me,but I bet you wanted to"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,13,Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,14,22
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,15,It seems like one of those nights
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,16,"This place is too crowded,too many cool kids,uh uh,uh uh"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,17,"(Who's Taylor Swift,anyway? Ew)"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,18,It seems like one of those nights
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,19,We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,20,Instead of sleeping
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,21,Yeah
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,22,"We're happy,free,confused,and lonely in the best way"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,23,"It's miserable and magical,oh yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,24,Tonight's the night when we forget about
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,25,"The heartbreaks,it's time"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,26,Oh oh
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,27,"I don't know about you,but I'm feeling 22"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,28,Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,29,"You don't know about me,but I bet you wanted to"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,30,Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,31,22
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,32,I don't know about you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,33,"22,22"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,34,It feels like one of those nights
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,35,We ditch the whole scene
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,36,It feels like one of those nights
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,37,We won't be sleeping
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,38,It feels like one of those nights
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,6,22,39,"You look like bad news,I gotta have you"

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,1,I was reminiscing just the other day
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,2,"While having coffee all alone and Lord,it took me away"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,3,Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,4,Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,5,"Took off faster than a green light,go"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,6,"Hey,you skip the conversation when you already know"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,7,I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,8,And that was the first day
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,9,"And darling,it was good never looking down"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,10,And right there where we stood was holy ground
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,11,Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,12,We had this big wide city all to ourselves
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,13,We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,14,And for the first time I had something to lose
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,15,And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,16,And the story's got dust on every page
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,17,But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,18,And I see your face in every crowd
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,19,"Cause darling,it was good never looking down"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,20,And right there where we stood was holy ground
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,21,Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,22,But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,11,Holy Ground,23,Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,17,The Moment I Knew,62,"And I said,""I'm sorry too"""
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,17,The Moment I Knew,63,And that was the moment I knew
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,1,You said it in a simple way
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,2,"4 AM,the second day"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,3,How strange that I don't know you at all
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,4,Stumbled through the long goodbye
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,5,"One last kiss,then catch your flight"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,6,Right when I was just about to fall
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,7,I told myself don't get attached
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,8,But in my mind I play it back
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,9,Spinning faster than the plane that took you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,10,And this is when the feeling sinks in
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,11,I don't wanna miss you like this

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,15,"Come back be here,come back be here"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,16,The delicate beginning rush
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,17,The feeling you can know so much
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,18,Without knowing anything at all
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,19,And now that I can put this down
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,20,If I had known what I'd known now
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,21,I never would have played so nonchalant
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,22,Taxi cabs and busy streets
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,23,That never bring you back to me
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,24,I can't help but wish you took me with you
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,25,And this is when the feeling sinks in

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,30,"Come back be here,come back be here"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,31,This is falling in love in the cruelest way
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,32,This is falling for you and you are worlds away
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,33,New York be here
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,18,Come Back... Be Here,34,But you're in London and I break down

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,5,I don't even know her
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,6,But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,7,"It's kinda like a code,yeah"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,8,And you've been getting closer and closer
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,9,And crossing so many lines

Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,23,You understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,24,"While she waits up,you chase down the newest thing"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,25,And take for granted what you have
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,26,And it would be a fine proposition
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,27,If I was a stupid girl
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,28,"And yeah,I might go with it"
Taylor Swift,2012,Red,19,Girl at Home,29,If I hadn't once been just like her

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,2,We line up weeping in a sunlit room
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,3,And if I'm on fire
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,4,"You'll be made of ashes,too"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,5,Even on my worst day

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,13,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,14,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,15,Wishing I stayed
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,16,Look at how my tears ricochet
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,17,We gather stones
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,18,Never knowing what they'll mean
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,19,Some to throw
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,20,Some to make a diamond ring
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,21,You know I didn't want to
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,22,Have to haunt you

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,25,That I gave you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,26,As you bury me
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,27,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,28,"Cause when I'd fight,you used to tell me I was brave"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,29,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,30,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,31,Wishing I'd stayed
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,32,Look at how my tears ricochet

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,36,"And you can aim for my heart,go for blood"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,37,But you would still miss me in your bones
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,38,And I still talk to you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,39,When I'm screaming at the sky

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,42,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,43,And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,44,"You had to kill me,but it killed you just the same"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,45,Cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,46,Wishing I stayed
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,47,You turned into your worst fears
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,48,And you're
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,49,Tossing out blame
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,50,Drunk on this pain
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,51,Crossing out the good years
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,52,And you're cursing my name
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,5,My Tears Ricochet,53,Wishing I stayed

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,20,You are not like the regulars
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,21,The masquerade revelers
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,22,Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,23,Hush

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,32,Shining just for you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,33,And they called off the circus
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,34,Burned the disco down
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,35,When they sent home the horses
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,36,And the rodeo clowns
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,37,I'm still on that tightrope
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,38,I'm still trying everything
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,39,to get you laughing at me
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,6,Mirrorball,40,I'm still a believer

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,4,"I was too scared to jump in but I,I was high"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,5,In the sky
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,6,With Pennsylvania under me Are there still beautiful things?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,7,Sweet tea in the summer
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,8,"Cross your heart,won't tell no other And though I can't recall your face"

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,15,And I think you should come live with me and we can be pirates
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,16,Then you won't have to cry Or hide in the closet
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,17,And just like a folk song
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,18,Our love will be passed on
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,19,Please picture me In the weeds
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,7,Seven,20,Before I learned civility I used to scream Ferociously

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,1,Salt air
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,2,And the rust on your door
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,3,I never needed anything more
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,4,Whispers of “are you sure?”
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,5,“Never have I ever before”
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,6,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,7,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,8,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,9,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,10,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,11,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,12,Your back beneath the sun
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,13,Wishing I could write my name on it
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,14,Will you call when you're back at school?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,15,I remember thinking I had you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,16,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,17,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,18,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,19,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,20,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,21,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,22,Back when we were still changing for the better
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,23,Wanting was enough
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,24,For me it was enough
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,25,To live for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,26,Cancel plans just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,27,And say “meet me behind the mall”
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,28,"So much for summer love,and saying “us”"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,29,Cause you weren't mine to lose
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,30,You weren't mine to lose
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,31,No
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,32,But I can see us lost in the memory
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,33,August slipped away into a moment in time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,34,Cause it was never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,35,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,36,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,37,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,38,Cause you were never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,39,Never mine
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,40,Do you remember?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,41,Remember when I pulled up
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,42,And said “get in the car”
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,43,And then canceled my plans
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,44,just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,45,Back when I was living for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,46,"For the hope of it all,“meet me behind the mall”"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,47,Remember when I pulled up
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,48,And said “get in the car”
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,49,And then canceled my plans
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,50,just in case you'd call
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,51,Back when I was living for the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,52,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,53,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,54,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,8,august,55,For the hope of it all
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,1,I've been having a hard time adjusting
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,2,I had the shiniest wheels
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,3,Now they're rusting
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,4,I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,5,I have a lot of regrets about that
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,6,Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,7,Could've followed my fears all the way down
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,8,And maybe I don't quite know what to say
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,9,But I'm here in your doorway
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,10,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,11,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,12,I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,13,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,14,They told me all of my cages were mental
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,15,So I got wasted like all my potential
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,16,And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,17,I have a lot of regrets about that
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,18,I was so ahead of the curve

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,20,Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,21,Pouring out my heart to a stranger
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,22,But I didn't pour the whiskey

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,26,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,27,At least I'm trying
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,28,And it's hard to be at a party
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,29,When I feel like an open wound
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,30,It's hard to be anywhere these days
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,31,When all I want is you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,32,You're a flashback in a film reel
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,33,On the one screen in my town...
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,34,And I just wanted you to know
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,35,That this is me trying
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,9,This Is Me Trying,36,I just wanted you to know

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,9,Ends with meetings in parking lots
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,10,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,11,And clandestine meetings
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,12,And longing stares
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,13,It's born from just one single glance
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,14,But it dies and it dies and it dies
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,15,...a million little times
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,16,Leave the perfume on the shelf

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,23,The first few hundred times
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,24,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,25,And clandestine meetings
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,26,And stolen stares
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,27,They show their truth one single time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,28,But they lie and they lie and they lie
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,10,Illicit Affairs,29,...a million little times

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,1,Green was the color of the grass
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,2,Where I used to read at Centennial Park
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,3,I used to think I would meet somebody there

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,13,Invisible string
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,14,Tying you to me
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,15,Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,16,You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,17,Bold was the waitress on our three year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,28,Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,29,Chains around my demons

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,33,For the boys who broke my heart
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,34,Now I send their babies presents
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,35,Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,36,Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,37,Time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,38,Wondrous time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,39,Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,11,Invisible String,40,And it's cool

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,7,Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,8,Does she smile
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,9,Or does she mouth “**** you forever”?

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,21,And there's nothing like a mad woman
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,22,Now I breathe flames each time I talk
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,23,My cannons all firing at your yacht
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,24,They say “move on”

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,41,And there's nothing like a mad woman
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,42,I'm taking my time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,43,Taking my time
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,44,Cause you took everything from me
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,45,Watching you climb
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,46,Watching you climb
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,12,Mad Woman,47,Over people like me

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,1,"Betty,I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,2,But I think it's cause of me

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,8,The worst thing that I ever did
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,9,Was what I did to you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,10,But if I just showed up at your party
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,11,Would you have me?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,12,Would you want me?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,13,Would you tell me to go f**k myself
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,14,Or lead me to the garden?

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,38,But I know I miss you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,39,I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,40,Just thinking of you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,41,when she pulled up
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,42,Like a figment of my worst intentions
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,43,"She said “James,get in,let's drive”"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,44,Those days turned into nights
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,45,Slept next to her but
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,46,I dreamt of you all summer long
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,47,"Betty,I'm here on your doorstep"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,48,And I planned it out for weeks now but it's finally sinking in
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,49,"Betty,right now is the last time I can dream about what happens when you see my face again"
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,50,The only thing I wanna do
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,51,Is make it up to you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,52,"So,I showed up at your party..."
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,53,"Yeah,I showed up at your party..."

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,59,Will it be just like I dreamed it?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,60,Will it patch your broken wings?
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,61,I'm only seventeen
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,62,I don't know anything
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,63,But I know I miss you

Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,65,Kissing in my car again
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,66,Stopped at a streetlight
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,14,betty,67,You know I miss you
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,15,Peace,1,Our coming of age has come and gone
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,15,Peace,2,Suddenly this summer it's clear
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,15,Peace,3,I never had the courage of my convictions
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,15,Peace,4,As long as danger is near
Taylor Swift,2020,Folklore,15,Peace,5,"And it's just around the corner,darling"
